### Overview
This is the repository holding the website documentation for the lessons that will be used for the Neuroimaging workshop. All of the lessons are markdown pages that GitHub renders as a website.
In order to make changes, please try to do the following:
1. When looking at the repository, please sue the branch **gh-pages**. This is where the active documentation of the website is held.
2. It is probably easiest just to make the edits within Github. Once you are ready to commit the changes. please commit them in a new branch.
3. When you are ready to publish the web page, please make a pull request and ask me to be a reviewer.
4. If any issues, please let me know.

### Target Audience
This hands-on workshop can serve as a beginners or refresher course for established investigators, clinicians, and trainees involved in the use of imaging techniques in the study of Alzheimerâ€™s disease, related disorders and normal aging.

### Requirements
Registrants will be required to bring their own laptops.  We will be asking attendees for specifications for hte la

### Workshop description
The workshop will provide practical information and an enhanced understanding on how to work with and analyze medical imaging data from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron imaging tomography (PET).

The initial portion of the workshop will focus on the understanding of the basic structure of an image, how to traverse images, data extraction, and how voxels relate to world coordinates.

Subsequent lectures will be followed by interactive sessions to demonstrate simple workflows including tissue segmentation, registration, and pre-processing steps of fMRI or DTI. The objective of the workshop is to ensure participants gain an in-depth appreciation of commonly used interpretive clinical and or research applications for each methodology. 

### Agenda
This is the tentative agenda for the workshop, Much of it will be self-paced with facilitation by the members of the organsiing committee, so if people want to focus more time on some areas than others, they are welcome to.
