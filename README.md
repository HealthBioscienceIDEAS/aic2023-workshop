### Overview
This is the repository holding the website documentation for the lessons that will be used for the Neuroimaging workshop. All of the lessons are markdown pages that GitHub renders as a website.
In order to make changes, please try to do the following:
1. When looking at the repository, please use the branch **gh-pages**. This is where the active documentation of the website is held.
2. It is probably easiest just to make the edits within Github. Once you are ready to commit the changes, please commit them in a new branch (it will give you the option to create a new branch when you make the first edit)
3. When you are ready to publish the web page, please make a pull request and ask me to be a reviewer.
4. If any issues, please let me know.
