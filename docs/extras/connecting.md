This page will tell you how to access your personal virtual (VM) to run these lessons. The virtual machine is essentially a "computer within a computer". For this workshop, we have created virtual machines that have all the necessary software to perform the lessons. 

If you are interested in running software on your own VM on the cloud, please check out the [NITRC Computational Environment](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/nitrc_es/), which has even more neuroimaging analysis software and should cover just about anything you would need.
