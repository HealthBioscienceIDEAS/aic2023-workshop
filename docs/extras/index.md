This section contains additional material which you will find helpful for the workshop. It currently includes:
* [Getting started with the command line](./command-line.md): Many neuroimaging software packages do not use a graphical interface but require you to be comfortable typing in commands into the computer. This section gives an overview of some basic commands and how to traverse a Linux filesystem.
* [Connecting to the workshop VM](./connecting.md): This contains information about how to access the computer that you will be using for the lessons. These computers are based in the cloud and have all of the software and data that you need.
