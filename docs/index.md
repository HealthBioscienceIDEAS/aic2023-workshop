# Alzheimer Imaging Consortium Educational Workshop
## Getting started With Neuroimaging Analysis

### Details

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Date | Friday 29th July 2022 |
| Time | 1-5 PM PST | 
| Location | Hilton San Diego Bayfront, San Diego, CA |
| Format | In-person workshop | 

### Target Audience
This hands-on workshop can serve as a beginners or refresher course for established investigators, clinicians, and trainees involved in the use of imaging techniques in the study of Alzheimer’s disease, related disorders and normal aging.

### Requirements
Registrants will be required to bring their own laptops.  We will be asking attendees for specifications for the laptops, so that we can best manage the workshop. We will all be using a standard environment for this workshop, using a virtual machine (VM), either on your laptop or on the cloud. This ensures that everyone will be seeing the exact same screen for these lessons, regardless of if you are using a Mac or Windows operating system. You can find out more how to access this virtual machine in the [Connecting](./connecting.md) section.

### Workshop description
The workshop will provide practical information and an enhanced understanding on how to work with and analyze medical imaging data from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron imaging tomography (PET).

The initial portion of the workshop will focus on the understanding of the basic structure of an image, how to traverse images, data extraction, and how voxels relate to world coordinates.

Subsequent lectures will be followed by interactive sessions to demonstrate simple workflows including tissue segmentation, registration, and pre-processing steps of fMRI or DTI. The objective of the workshop is to ensure participants gain an in-depth appreciation of commonly used interpretive clinical and or research applications for each methodology. 


### Agenda
This is the tentative agenda for the workshop. You can find links to all of the individual lessons below. Much of it will be self-paced with facilitation by the members of the organizing committee, so if people want to focus more time on some areas than others, they are welcome to.
