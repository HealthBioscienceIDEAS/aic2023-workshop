# Thank you for attending!

We really hope you enjoyed today's workshop. Thank you for being a part of the first-ever Neuroimaging PIA hands-on event. We hope that you found it very helpful as you start your journey doing research with neuroimaging data. 

At the end of this workshop, we would really appreciate you filling out the [feedback form](https://forms.gle/NCJS5uSZVcFDHHPv9) for the workshop. Your feedback on how things went, and how it could be improved, is vital to the future planning of this workshop.

If you have any further questions about items from the workshop, please contact David Cash <d.cash@ucl.ac.uk> or any of the other instructors.

If you want more time to work on lessons, there are a couple of options:
* Most of the VMs will be destroyed shortly after the course. Please let the organizers know if you would like your VM up for additional time.
* We can also provide assistance if you would like any help installing the VM locally. 
* This website with all of the instructions will remain online and publicly available.

## Thanks again and enjoy the rest of AAIC!
